Question 1:  What are the different Bug priorities?
Andswer:    There are five kinds of diffrent bug priorities.
            1: Blocker (Highest)
            2: Critical(High)
            3: Major  (Medium)
            4: Minor  (Low)
            5: Trivial (Lowest)

Question 2:  What is a bug life cycle?
Answer:      Bug Life cycle is the journey of a defect from its identification to its closure.
             phases of bug life cycle.

Question 3:  What do you include in a bug report?
Answer:      Bug Rerport is the documentation which explains the whole information about the specific bug found.
             Bug Report:
             1: Bug ID (Auto Generated)
             2: Summary about the bug 
             3: Project information
             4: Priority
                  a: Blocket(Highest)
                  b: Critical(High)
                  c: Major (Medium)
                  d: Minor (Low)
                  e: Trivial (lowest)
              5: Description 
                  a: Steps to reproduce
                  b: Current Result
                  c: Expected Result
              6: Asginee (Developer)
              7: Assigner (QA)
              8: Verifier
              9: Local verb (Languages on demand)
              10: Screenshots
              11: Test Environment
              
  Question 4:  What do you do if you log a defect and the developer says he wont fix it?
  Answer:     Fisrt of all we should try to find out is that a valid bug or not.if yes then try again to explain situation
              to the DEVELOPER that its aa blocker/critical or any bug. if still he is saying not to fix that. then go and ask 
              to the PROJECT MANAGER if he also not agrees with you and you still found its a valid bug then talk to the 
              PRODUCT MANAGER.
              
  Question 5:   What steps do you take after you find a bug in production?
  Answer:       Deploy a single version of code to all environments, so that all testing is done on the same version of code 
                that is deployed to production. If the single version needs to do something differently in different 
                environments, do that by making that something configurable and changing configuration (environment variables, 
                configuration files, database data, etc.) in different environments, not the code.

                Make development and production environments as much alike as possible: use the same or a similar OS, 
                use the same version of the language runtime and libraries, etc. Some projects develop on VMs so that 
                they can have the exact same environment in development and production.

                Completely automate deployment so there is no opportunity for manual errors to introduce bugs.
                
                Eliminate the hardware or platform as a cause
                

Question 7:  What is STLC? Explain with a block diagram?
Answer:     STLC: Software Test Life Cycle Specifies the various stages of software development.

          1: Requirement Analysis:
             During this phase, test team studies the requirements from a testing point of view to identify the 
             testable requirements. The QA team may interact with various stakeholders to understand the 
             requirements in detail. Requirements could be either Functional  or Non Functional.
        
          2: Test Planning:
             This phase is also called Test Strategy phase. Typically , in this stage, a Senior QA manager will 
             determine effort and cost estimates for the project and would prepare and finalize the Test Plan.  
         
          3: Test Case Development
             This phase involves creation, verification and rework of test cases & test scripts. Test data 
            is identified/created and is reviewed and then reworked as well.
         
          4: Test Environment Setup
             Test environment decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is tested. 
             Test environment set-up is one of the critical aspects of testing process and can be done in parallel 
             with Test Case Development Stage. 
          
          5: Test Execution:
             During this phase test team will carry out the testing based on the test plans and the test cases 
             prepared. Bugs will be reported back to the development team for correction and retesting will be performed.
        
          6: Test Cycle Closure
             Testing team will meet , discuss and analyze testing artifacts to identify strategies that have to be 
             implemented in future, taking lessons from the current test cycle. The idea is to remove the process 
             bottlenecks for future test cycles and share best practices for any similar projects in future.
             
             
Question 8:  If you open a web page of your test application and the page keeps loading but never displays the full page 
             how do you go about checking where the problem is?
Answer:      when user faced this kind of issue there might be given probabilities.
              1. If face issue  like this try to refresh the page.
              2: if problem still occurs then  there might some cookies/cache in the temp storage of the system so try
                 to clear cookies and cache.
              3: if still same issue then try to restart the browser.
              4: if still same issue then there must be some issue in browser try to change the browser.
              5: if still same issue then there might be some issue with the website. check your url is the link correct?
              5: if still same issure then there might be some issue with the coding which put the website in the loop.
              6: there must be problem in linking of the website to the domain.
              7: there must be problem with the server of the website.which not allows the domain to load/access the pages on site.
              8: check the internet connection.
              9: there must be problem with loading plugins if plugins required to load the page.
              10: there must be issue with the system.
